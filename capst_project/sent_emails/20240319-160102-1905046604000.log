Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address .
Follow the link below:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/reset/Mg/c458hq-ab7c617dc5231d2e36ba3a11624b73ab/

In case you forgot your username: 

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Boards Team
